This dApp takes part of the [LearnWeb3DAO's](https://learnweb3.io/) Sophomore course. It is a simple dApp that allows users to add their Ethereum address to a whitelist limited to 10 addresses. The dApp is built using React and uses the MetaMask wallet to sign transactions. The dApp is deployed on the Goerli testnet.

You can find the tutorial for this dApp [here](https://learnweb3dao.gitbook.io/learn-web3-dao/sophomore-course/whitelist-dapp).

I recommend you to follow the Video tutorial, even if it is a bit outdated, then search by yourself how to change the outdated rinkeby network presented to the Video for the Goerli Test network.
If you want to learn and memorize the code, AVOID to copy and paste the code from the text tutorial !!
Practice, practice, practice !!
They use QuickNode to deploy the smart contract, but I choose Alchemy to deploy it on the Goerli testnet.

For the Next/React part, I've decided to keep the exact code from the tutorial because:

- Their comments are very useful to understand the code, learn and memorize it.
- I have made others projects with React and I wanted to spend time to learn the solidity part.

You can find my deployed dApp [here](https://goerli-whitelist-app.vercel.app//).
